# Feniks

Relatively cheap wifi enabled 4 channel BBQ thermometer based on a ESP32-C3.

The system is powered by an 18650 li-ion battery, and has integrated battery charge and protection circuitry.

The temperature probe data is displayed on a small I2C OLED screen as well as a webserver hosted on the ESP.
